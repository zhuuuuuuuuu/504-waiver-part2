MI Symptoms is a symptom survey to be taken daily by Michigan residents
and employees, for early detection of COVID-like illnesses by Michigan public
health professionals and employers. This symptom survey may also help us better
understand what influences the spread of the virus. The survey will inform you
if your symptoms are similar to COVID-19 and provide a method for Michiganders
to check their daily wellness during the pandemic.
