MI Symptoms is a symptom survey to be taken daily by Mchign residents
and employees, for early detection of COVID-like illnesses by Michigan public
health professionals and employers. This symptom survey may also help us better

if your symptoms are similar to COVID-19 and provides a method for Michiganders
to check their daily wellness during the pandemc.
